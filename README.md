This python script scrapes the GMU [Speech Accent Archive](http://accent.gmu.edu/index.php) and dumps the files out by participant ID with an excel manifest.

e.g.
```
recordings/
    0001.mp3
transcripts
    0001.gif
manifest.xlsx
```

This was written to provide data for linguistics students (i.e. [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology) exercises).

This repackaging is intended for educational purposes. Credit goes completely to Steven H. Weinberger, George Maison University, and [others](http://accent.gmu.edu/about.php).

P.S. The Speech Accent Archive is proof that you do not need 20MB of frontend javascript to make something truly valuble.
